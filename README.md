# Factors that affect students performance in high school Mathematics.
This was my first project ever, completed during my Data Science course.

The requirements were as shown below:

* The purpose of the Mini Project is to reinforce skills that have been covered in recent modules. 

* Choose a business problem and translate it into a data science problem. Select a data set and analyse it using the techniques learned in recent modules. The techniques include (but not limited to) the following: Data Wrangling, Feature Engineering, EDA.

* Prepare and present a 8-minute Powerpoint presentation for stakeholders and a 5 min Jupyter Notebook for technical discussion in class.

Besides the basic requirements, I also experimented with hypothesis testing.
